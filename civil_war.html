			<dt>1861</dt>
			
			<dd id=m>-The <u>Civil War started</u> with the attack on <b>Fort Sumter</b>. This fort held federal troops, and it was running out of supplies, so president Lincoln sent in provisions. 
			The southerners thought that weapons were being sent instead, so they attacked.
			<ul id=b>-As a result, Lincoln used some of his executive powers without apporval of Congress
			<ul>-he increased the size of the federal army</ul>
			<ul>-he authorized spending for the war</ul>
			<ul>-he suspended the habeas corpus, which allowed convicts to have a trial in court</ul></ul>
			</dd><br>
			
			<dd>-The first <b>Confiscation Act of 1861</b>, was inspired by Union General Benjamin Butler, who refused to return captured slaves to their owners. <u>It gave the power to
			seize enemy property</u>.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=m>-The <b>Battle of Bull Run</b> was the first major battle of the civil war. <u>Federal Troops</u> marched from D.C. to Bull Run Creek to attack Confederate troops, but they were
			<u>defeated by General Thomas (Stonewall) Jackson</u>.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=e>-The <b>Morrill Tariff Act</b> increased tariff rates to protect northern industries. <u>Because of this, Republicans started supporting high protective tariffs.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dt>1862</dt>
			
			<dd id=m>-Confederate General Robert E. Lee was going to invade the North so that Britain would be convinced to help the Confederacy. His plans were intercepted, and the Union 
			soldiers (under General McClellan) intercepted Lee's troops at <b>Antietam Creek</b>. The North won, and the southerners retreated. <u>This battle prevented the Confederacy from 
			achieving foreing recognition</u>.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=m>-The North's strategy to blockade the South was ruined by the Confederate ship, Merrimac. This ship was an ironclad and could sink the wooden Union ships.
			To retaliate, the Union navy created its own iron clad, the Monitor. The <b>Monitor-Merrimac duel</b> resulted in a draw, but <u>it revolutionized navy warfare</u>.</dd><br>
			
			<dd>-The <b>Confiscation Act of 1862</b> <u>freed the slaves of owners engaged in rebellion and also the president to use free slaves in the Union Army.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dd id=s>-The <b>Homestead Act</b> gave 160 acres to whoever settled in the Great Plains for five years. <u>It promoted westernization.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dd id=s>-The <b>Morrill Land Grant Act</b> encouraged states to <u>build colleges</u> on federal land grants.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=s>-The <b>Pacific Railway Act</b> allowed the construction of a transconinental railroad. The railroad <u>linked the West and the East</u>, which allowed trade between
			the two regions. It also allowed people two travel a longer distance in a shorter time. Unfortunately, railroad companies started to monopolize, which angered many farmers who
			were on land owned by the monopolies.</dd><br>
			
			<dt>1863</dt>
			
			<dd>-The <b>Emancipation Proclamation</b> <u>changed the reason of the war from preserving the Union to freeing the slaves,</u> which gave morale to the union armies. <u>It abolished slavery only in states that are
			in rebellion</u>, though it did not immediately free those slaves. Also, <u>since many Europeans were against slavery, their governments could not support the South anymore.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dd id=m>-The northern victory at <b>Vicksburg</b> was a major victory. After the Confederates surrendered, <u>the North had controll of the Mississippi River</u>, and they cut off
			Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas from the rest of the Confederacy.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=m>-The <b>Battle of Gettysburg</b> is considered the <u>turning point in the American Civil War.</u> Confederate General Lee took the offensive hoping that a victory would 
			persuade the North to call for peace, but the Confederates were defeated, and Lee and his troops retreated to Virginia. <ul id=bn>-Lincoln gave his famous <b>Gettysburg Address</b>
			, which <u>reminded Union soldiers that they were fighting to preserve the Union.</u></ul></dd><br> 
			
			<dd>-Even though Virginia was part of the Confederacy (in fact, the capital of the Confederacy was in Richmond, Virginia), <u>the people of western Virginia was loyal to the Union</u>.
			Therefore, <b>West Virgina</b> became a seperate state.</dd><br>
			
			<dd>-Congress passed the <b>first Conscription Act</b>. This made all men between the ages 20 and 45 serve in the military, but a draftee could avoid service by paying  300
			dollars  or finding a substitute. This caused riots, mostly by Irish Americans, since workers believed that their jobs would be taken away by freed slaves.</dd><br>
			
			<dd id=e>-Congress created a <b>National Banking System</b> to manage the revenue in the U.S Treasury. <ul id=b>-the paper currency was known as <b id=e>Greenbacks</b></ul></dd>
			
			<dt>1864</dt>
			
			<dd id=m>-General Sherman marched into the south, destroying everything in his way. He brought the war to the civilians. <b>Sherman's March</b> included the use of 
			<u>total war.</u> General Sherman took Atlanta in September, he burned down Columbia on Febuary of the following year.</dd>
			
			<dt>1865</dt>
			
			<dd>-The <b> thireenth amendment</b> <u>abolished slavery.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dd id=m>-General Robert E. Lee surrendered to Grant at <b>Appomattox Court House</b> on April 9. <u>This marked the end of the Civil War.</u></dd><br>
			
			<dd>-On April 14, <b>John Wilkes Booth assasinated president Lincoln</b> at Ford's Theatre. This tragedy <u>foiled Lincoln's vision of reconstruction.</u></dd><br>
